## Why Fresh?

Discover the reasons behind choosing Fresh over existing libraries, summed up in three key aspects:

- Simplicity
- Resilience
- Control

### Simplicity

Fresh is designed with simplicity in mind, offering a user-friendly API that includes clear examples and comprehensive documentation.

### Resilience

Fresh excels in ensuring a robust and enduring connection to the server. By default, Fresh promptly re-establishing the connection when the server terminates the connection or encounters any connectivity issues. When used alongside Supervisor, Fresh delivers exceptional reliability.

### Control

With Fresh, you gain extensive control over the flow of WebSocket connections, including control over resilience. You can manage scenarios requiring reconnection, identify those that should be ignored, specify when to gracefully terminate a connection, and even instruct Supervisor to restart your process as needed. Additionally, Fresh allows you to leverage custom `Mint.WebSocket` options, transport layer options, custom headers, and more, providing you with the flexibility you require.

## Installation

Package can be installed by adding `fresh` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:fresh, "~> 0.3.0"}
  ]
end
```

### Compatibility

This library is well-tested with the following versions of Elixir and Erlang/OTP:

- Elixir 1.14 or newer
- Erlang/OTP 25 or newer

While it may also work with older versions, we strongly recommend using the specified minimum versions for the best experience.

## Example

Below is an example of a WebSocket client that handles incoming frames to implement a simple counter:

_It is worth mentioning that this example module contains approximately 15 lines of code._

```elixir
defmodule EchoWebSocket do
  use Fresh

  def handle_connect(_status, _headers, _state) do
    IO.puts("Start counting from 0")
    {:reply, [{:text, "1"}], 0}
  end

  def handle_in({:text, number}, _state) do
    number = String.to_integer(number)

    IO.puts("Number: #{number}")
    {:reply, [{:text, "#{number + 1}"}], number}
  end
end
```
