# Bousou

Bousou (暴走) is a WebSocket client for Elixir, built on top of [Mint](https://github.com/elixir-mint).

## Goals

- Bousou aims to provide a simple, easy-to-use API.
- Bousou is always _trying_ to be connected, using [gen_statem](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gen_statem.html).
- Everything in Bousou should be _well-documented_ for both users and future contributors.

## License

Bousou is licensed under the MIT license.
