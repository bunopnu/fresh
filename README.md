# Bousou

**Bousou** (**暴走**) is a WebSocket client for Elixir, built atop the [Mint](https://github.com/elixir-mint) ecosystem.

**Bousou** is an attempt to create a light, reliable and high-level WebSocket client based on [Mint.WebSocket](https://github.com/elixir-mint/mint_web_socket).

## Key Features

**Bousou** aims to provide a straightforward, user-friendly API complete with examples and comprehensive documentation.

**Bousou** maintains an enduring connection to the server, promptly re-establishing it as soon as the server closes the connection _(or something goes wrong in general, mostly)_.

**Bousou** offers flexibility by allowing you to utilise `Mint.WebSocket` extensions and transport options, and provides access to a wide range of values.
